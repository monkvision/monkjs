# Getting Started
## Creating Your App
The current React version supported by the MonkJs SDK is [React 19](https://react.dev/versions#react-19). We do not
guarantee proper functioning of the SDK on other React versions than this one. TypeScript is supported by default in the
SDK, and you do not need to install any additional package to use the MonkJs type definitions in your app.

We do not require any specific loader like Webpack etc. Our SDK can be used on virtually any project as long as you're
using React 19. We plan on creating Create-React-App templates to allow developers to bootstrap new MonkJs webapps more
easily. Until then, you can either create your app manually, or start by copying our official
[Demo App](https://github.com/monkvision/monkjs/tree/main/apps/demo-app) to start your project.
