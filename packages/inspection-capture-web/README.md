# @monkvision/inspection-capture-web
This package provides utils, tools and ready-to-use components used to capture pictures needed to run Monk inspections.
There are two main workflows for capturing pictures of a vehicle for a Monk inspection :
- The **PhotoCapture** workflow : the user is shown a certain set of car wireframes, called *Sights*, and they are asked
  to take pictures of the vehicle by aligning the vehicle with the Sight overlays.
- The **VideoCapture** workflow : the user is asked to record a quick video of their vehicle by filming it and rotating
  in a full circle around it.
- The **DamageDisclosure** workflow : The user is guided to capture close-up pictures of specific damaged parts of the vehicle. There are 2 workflows available:
  - Part-selection: Before taking the picture, the user must first select the damaged part on the vehicle wireframe then a close-up picture of the damage.
  - Two-shot: The user is asked to take, first a wide picture of the vehicle, then a close-up picture of the damage.

# Installing
To install the package, you can run the following command :

```shell
yarn add @monkvision/inspection-capture-web
```

If you are using TypeScript, this package comes with its type definitions integrated, so you don't need to install
anything else!

# PhotoCapture
The PhotoCapture workflow is aimed at guiding users in taking pictures of their vehicle in order to add them to a Monk
inspection. The user is shown a set of car wireframes, which we call *Sights* and that are available in the
`@monkvision/sights` package. These Sights act as guides, and the user is asked to take pictures of their vehicle by
aligning it with the Sights.

Please refer to the [official MonkJs documentation](https://monkvision.github.io/monkjs/docs/photo-capture-workflow) to
have a detailed overview of the Photo Capture workflow.

## PhotoCapture component
This package exports a ready-to-use single-page component called `PhotoCapture` that implements the PhotoCapture
workflow. In order to use it, simply create a new page in your application containing just this component. You will then
need to generate a Monk authentication token (using Auth0), and create a new inspection, in which all tasks statuses are
set to `NOT_STARTED` (so that we can add images to them later). You can then pass the api config (with the auth token),
the inspection ID, as well as a list of Sights (to display to the user) to the `PhotoCapture` component. Once the user
has completed the capture workflow, the `onComplete` callback will be called, and you will then be able to navigate to
another page. The complete list of configuration props for this component is available at the end of this section.

```tsx
import { sights } from '@monkvision/sights';
import { PhotoCapture } from '@monkvision/inspection-capture-web';

const PHOTO_CAPTURE_SIGHTS = [
  sights['fesc20-0mJeXBDf'],
  sights['fesc20-26n47kaO'],
  sights['fesc20-2bLRuhEQ'],
  sights['fesc20-4Wqx52oU'],
  sights['fesc20-Tlu3sz8A'],
];

const apiDomain = 'api.preview.monk.ai/v1';

export function MonkPhotoCapturePage({ authToken }) {
  return (
    <PhotoCapture
      inspectionId={inspectionId}
      apiConfig={{ apiDomain, authToken }}
      sights={PHOTO_CAPTURE_SIGHTS}
      onComplete={() => { /* Navigate to another page */ }}
    />
  );
}
```

# VideoCapture
The VideoCapture workflow is aimed at asking users to record a walkaround video of their vehicle (around ~1min per
video) to send vehicle inspection pictures to the Monk API. In reality, no video is being recorded. Instead, screenshots
of the camera stream a repeatidly taken while the users walks around their vehicle. An algorithm is run to select the
best video frames (the less blurry ones), and they are then sent to the Monk API.

Please refer to the [official MonkJs documentation](https://monkvision.github.io/monkjs/docs/photo-capture-workflow) to
have a detailed overview of the Video Capture workflow.

## VideoCapture component
This package exports a ready-to-use single-page component called `VideoCapture` that implements the VideoCapture
workflow. The implementation for it is extremely similar to the `PhotoCapture` component described above. The only
difference being the configuration options that differ, as well as the fact that you need to pass certain parameters
when creating your inspection to ake sure it will be able to receive video frames as inputs (if you are creating your
inspection using the `createInspection` requests of the MonkJs SDK, you can simply set the `isVideoCapture` option to
`true`).

```tsx
import { sights } from '@monkvision/sights';
import { VideoCapture } from '@monkvision/inspection-capture-web';

const apiDomain = 'api.preview.monk.ai/v1';

export function MonkVideoCapturePage({ authToken }) {
  return (
    <VideoCapture
      inspectionId={inspectionId}
      apiConfig={{ apiDomain, authToken }}
      onComplete={() => { /* Navigate to another page */ }}
    />
  );
}
```

# DamageDisclosure

The DamageDisclosure workflow is designed to guide users in documenting and disclosing damage to their vehicles during a Monk inspection.
This workflow is ideal for capturing detailed images of specific damages such as dents, scratches, or other issues that need to be highlighted in the inspection report.
There are 2 workflows available.

Please refer to the [official MonkJs documentation](https://monkvision.github.io/monkjs/docs/photo-capture-workflow) for a comprehensive overview of the Add damage workflow.

## DamageDisclosure component

This package exports a ready-to-use single-page component called DamageDisclosure that implements the DamageDisclosure workflow. You can integrate it into your application by creating a new page containing only this component. Before using it, you must generate an Auth0 authentication token and create a new inspection using the Monk API. Ensure that all task statuses in the inspection are set to NOT_STARTED.

You can then pass the inspection ID, API configuration (including the auth token). Once the user completes the workflow, the onComplete callback is triggered, allowing you to navigate to another page or perform additional actions.

The following example demonstrates how to use the DamageDisclosure component:

```tsx
import { DamageDisclosure } from '@monkvision/inspection-capture-web';

const apiDomain = 'api.preview.monk.ai/v1';

export function MonkDamageDisclosurePage({ authToken }) {
  return (
    <DamageDisclosure
      inspectionId={inspectionId}
      apiConfig={{ apiDomain, authToken }}
      onComplete={() => { /* Navigate to another page */ }}
    />
  );
}
```
